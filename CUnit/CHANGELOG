HISTORY

2004/08/02 19:29:17 add --help and -h flags to comand line options
2004/08/02 19:17:26 Bug Fix: the suite pointer during the run phase. This is to ensure that the suite pointer is valid when the suite is run, as pointer aquired during the compile phase may be differnet when the shared object is opend for a second time during the run phase. (Thanks to Jaco Breitenbach <jjb@herfs.net> for spotting this and the suggested solution)
2004/04/09 13:54:25 remove the explicit package name - this can simply be included in the suite name and separated via '::'
2004/04/07 20:21:43 change API to use UTEST_PASS, UTEST_FAIL and UTEST_ASSERT
2004/03/25 06:08:40 clean up build by pretty printing commands
2004/03/24 06:10:08 update build to build into a build directory rather than under src
2004/02/14 09:56:57 made searching for test suites more robust by checking return code of stat and opendir.  fixed resource leak due to opendir not being matched by a closedir.
2004/01/29 17:32:13 put variable at the top of the function so that it will compile with gcc 2.95.x
2004/01/25 08:36:08 added better reporting if no tests were found.
2003/12/10 19:23:14 now build objects in the .objects directory
2003/11/20 20:38:17 made code more compilant to older C standards
2003/11/18 18:09:52 added LGPL license information and copyright info
2003/11/15 20:59:34 more documentation updates
2003/11/15 20:37:17 fix up build a little more and add ./configure into docs
2003/11/15 20:30:27 change build to support autoconf and hence configure
2003/11/15 14:09:28 better error reporting for setup/teardown init/fini errors
2003/11/15 13:28:09 some cleanup in the build and documentation
2003/11/13 17:48:40 more cleanups re layout of code - all output should now be channeled through show.c
2003/11/11 20:26:18 moved different functions into separate files to make maintenance easier
2003/10/14 06:15:47 start splitting up cunit into different parts.
2003/09/26 20:19:27 added package name tag into the suite structure
2003/09/22 19:52:14 added banner and command line that accepts a search directory name
2003/08/11 20:58:42 add more colour and time measurement
2003/07/31 06:03:02 added colourisation
2003/07/09 20:13:57 small fixes to tester

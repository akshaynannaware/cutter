          |   - cut_fork() -> sub testN (multi thread mode)
          +-> assert the above resutls
* elapsed time assert. (compare with past elapsed time?)
* test history chart.
  * N tests
  * N failures

* coordinattion with TestLink.
* image diff.
* failmalloc like memory test.
* CutSubProcessGroup for multi process test.
  It provides cut_sub_process_group_add() and cut_sub_process_group_wait().
* more intelligent crashed reporting.
  * get the latest unfinished test and bundle it into crashed reporting.
  * CutRunContext should have multiple crashed information.

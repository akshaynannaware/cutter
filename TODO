* priority mode.

* coordinattion with TestLink.
* image diff.
* failmalloc like memory test.
* CutSubProcess for multi process test.
  It delegates signals of CutPipeline (sub process) to parent process's
  CutRunContext.
* CutTestIterator supports multi thread.
* more intelligent crashed reporting.
  * get the latest unfinished test and bundle it into crashed reporting.
  * CutRunContext should have multiple crashed information.
